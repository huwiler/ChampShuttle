Coming June '14!  The newly redesigned and retina optimized ChampShuttle app allows you to track Champlain College shuttles, keep current on Champlain news, and search Champlain resources.

If you are interested in learning about iOS development and how this app was built, sign up for the Mobile Programming with Objective-C at Champlain College Continuing Professional Studies (http://classlist.champlain.edu/course/description/number/SDEV_302).
