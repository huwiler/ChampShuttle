Coming ~~October '14!~~  

UPDATE: Sadly, due to life and workload spikes, I did not have time to complete this project before it was obsolete.  I'm planning now to rewrite in Swift in a new repo.  Please feel free to take and run with this nearly completed Objective-C version of ChampShuttle if you wish.

The newly redesigned and retina optimized ChampShuttle app allows you to track Champlain College shuttles, keep current on Champlain news, and search Champlain resources.

If you are interested in learning about iOS development and how this app was built, sign up for the Mobile Programming with Objective-C at Champlain College Online & Continuing Education (http://classlist.champlain.edu/course/description/number/SDEV_302).
